# NLW Spacetime 🚀🪐⏳

This project is a **time capsule to record relevant moments of your life**, allowing you to register some text or media that remembers an event on a specific date. In addition, all memories are arranged on a timeline. The application is being developed at **Rocketseat's Next Level Week (NLW) event**.

This project has a mobile version developed with **React Native** and **Expo**, in addition to using **NativeWind** (**TailwindCSS** for React Native) for styling. In addition, the web front-end uses **React.js** in conjunction with **Next.js** and also with **Tailwind**. The back-end uses **Node.js** and the **Fastify** framework, together with **Prisma ORM** to communicate with the database and **Docker** to up the **PostgreSQL** container.
